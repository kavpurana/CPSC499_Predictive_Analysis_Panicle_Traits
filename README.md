# Predictive Analysis of The Genetic Architecture of Panicle Traits in Oryza sativa

### Overall Goal
We need to establish a subtle link between panicle size and yield performance
### What Did The Project Aim to Show?
* Using flowering as a covariate (an independent variable that can influence the outcome of a statistical trial but not of direct interest)
* We conduct a genome wide association study to detect a number of subpopulation specific associations and dissect multitrait peaks using panicle phenotype covariates grain length phenotype statistics

### Supplementary Dataset 5
Explores pleiotropy of shared genetic regions which affect multiple traits (search for Supplementary Dataset 5 in article)
* Uses covariate phenotypic traits in a GWAS
* Highlights QLTs or SNPs (regions of genome) associated with multiple traits
  * Helps us identify genetic locus that effect traits that we are selecting
  * Can we specifically find loci that result in traits such as yield or panicle size?
* Also gives information on subpopulations such as Indica or Japonica which might show show certain SNPs are significant in their subpopulations
  * Do one of the subpopulations Indica, Japonica, Aus, Ind, or Trj show more significant results in SNPs or QTLs where yield or panicle size is greater?

### Background definitions:
* QTLs - Quantitative trait locus:
  * statistical method of linking phenotypic data (trait measurements) and genotypic data (molecular markers)
  * allows researchers to link certain complex phenotypes (***such as panicle flowering) to specific regions of chromosomes
* SNPs - Single Nucleotide  Polymorphisms:
  * variation in DNA sequence where a nucleotide base pair differs between individuals at a specific location in the genome
  *  AAGCCTA <-> AAGCTTA (two alleles)
  * acts as a marker
  * this can link to specific traits or diseases
  * most abundant type of genetic variation in human genome
  * deletions, insertions, or substitutions
* Covariate:
  * how factors other than the main variable of interest can affect the outcome of a genetic study
  * since we are looking at pleitropy its important to have other traits be covariates so we can see the correlation of QTLs with the traits
* pleitropy:
  * single gene or mutation affects multiple traits or characteristics
  * people used to think one gene = one trait
  * Similar seeing if one gene = flowering and  
* genetic locus or loci:
  * specific physical location of a gene or other DNA sequence on a chromosome like a genetic street address
  * loci is plural

### My Objectives
Based on this dataset:
1. Can we specifically find loci that result in traits such as yield or panicle size?
2. Do one of the subpopulations Indica, Japonica, Aus, Ind, or Trj show more significant results in SNPs or QTLs where yield or panicle size is greater?
3. Can we create a model that will successfully predict panicle size and yield traits based on specific QTLs or SNPs?
